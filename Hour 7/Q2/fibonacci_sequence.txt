Fibonacci sequence - Integers in an Array
Problem statement
You are given an array of non-negative integers, arr, of size array_length. How many elements in arr are Fibonacci numbers?
Fibonacci numbers, denoted F(n), form a sequence known as the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the two
preceding numbers starting with 0 and 1.
That is F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1 and F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
The first 10 terms of the Fibonacci sequence are listed below
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34
Example 1
Input
4
1
1
1
1
Output
4
Explanation
1 is a Fibonacci number and it is contained in arr four times. Hence the output is 4.
Example 2
Input
5
2 4 8 16 31
Output
2
Explanation
2 and 8 are the only Fibonacci numbers in arr. Hence, the output is 2
Example 3
Input
7
0
1
2
3
4
5
4
Output
5
Explanation
0, 1, 2, 3 and 5 are the only Fibonacci numbers in arr. Hence the output is 5.
Input Format
The first line contains an integer, array_length, denoting the number of elements in arr.
Each line i of the array_length subsequent lines (where 0 <= i < array_length) contains an integer describing arr[i].
Output Format
The output prints an integer denoting the number of Fibonacci numbers in arr as specified in the problem statement.
