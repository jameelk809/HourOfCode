Problem statement
You are provided with 3 numbers: input1, input2, and input3. Each of these is four-digit numbers within the range >=1000 and<=9999 i.e. 
1000 <= input1 <= 9999 
1000 <= input2 <= 9999 
1000 <= input3 <= 9999 
You are expected to find the Key using the below formula 
Key = 
    [SMALLEST digit in the thousands place of all three numbers] 
    [LARGEST digit in the hundreds place of all three numbers] 
    [SMALLEST digit in the tens place of all three numbers] 
    [LARGEST digit in the units place of all three numbers]
Given three numbers, write an algorithm to find the key using the above-mentioned formula.

Example 

Input
3521 2452 1352

Output
1522

Explanation
Key = [smallest digit in the thousands place of all three numbers] [LARGEST digit in the hundreds place of all three numbers]
[smallest digit in the tens place of all three numbers] [LARGEST digit in the units place of all three numbers] 
If input1 = 3521, input2=2452, input3-1352, then Key = [1][5][2][2] = 1522.

Input Format
The input consists of three space-separated integers - input1, input2 and input3 representing the three four-digit numbers.

Output Format
Print an integer representing the concatenation of four digits where the first digit represents the smallest digit in the thousands place of all
three numbers; the second digit represents the largest digit in the hundreds place of all three numbers; the third digit represents the smallest
digit in the tens place of all three numbers and the fourth digit represents the largest digit in the units place of all three numbers
