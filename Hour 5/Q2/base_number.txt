Problem statement
Base number
The alphabetical order of letters is their base number. i.e , base number of A=1,B=2,C=3,D=4 and so on.
Implement the given function
Static string decodemessage(string msg){ }
The function accepts a string ‘msg’ as its argument. ‘msg’ contains an encoded message, where encoded characters are separated
with a space. Implement the function to find and return the decoded message that has been encoded as follows:
Each letter was converted to its base number
A space is converted to an underscore( _ )
number is preceded by the number symbol ( # )
Note
[1]   Return all letters in upper case
[2]   Return space in decoded message only when underscore symbol ( _ ) appears in ‘msg’
[3]   If ‘msg’ is empty or “NULL” return “NULL”.

Example

Input
2 1 4 _ 3 1 20 @ # 459

Output
BAD CAT @459

Explanation

Encoded                             Decoded
2                                             B
1                                             A
4                                             D
_                                            
3                                             C
1                                             A
20                                            T
_
@                                             @
# 459                                         459

Thus output is BAD CAT @459

Input Format
Input string represents encoded message.

Output Format
Display decoded message.

Constraints
Length of the decoded string will always be less than or equal to the given string length.
Decoded message will not contain underscore( _ ) and symbol ( # )
